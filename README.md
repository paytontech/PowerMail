# Powermail
## what is powermail?
powermail is a powerful email client written in SwiftUI. It will be available for both macOS and iOS. It is written with [MailCore2](https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2), a powerful POP, IMAP, and STMP API for Objective-C.

##where is powermail?
under development - beta coming soon

##why is powermail?
99% of email clients today are simply bad - powermail hopes to change that.

##when is powermail?
i currently don't have an exact date for when it will be ready, but expect it sometime early next month

##how is powermail?
powermail is written in SwiftUI, and uses [MailCore2](https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2) as it's email API.

##email providers?
powermail will be available for Gmail and Yahoo users during the beta, however by launch it will be available to all major email providers, and even not-major email providers.

##security?
of course, security and privacy is very important to me and many people, which is why powermail will be designed with security & privacy in mind. you will be able to lock the app with biometrics (either TouchID or FaceID), and you will also be able to passcode lock it, or even do BOTH, if you really have that much people trying to look in to your email inbox. and obviously, we won't be able to see your emails, nor will we sell any data at all. you may not trust us with that statement, but that's why it's open-source. so that if you're one of the people who doesn't trust us, you can see for yourself.
